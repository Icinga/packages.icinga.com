## Linux Support

Icinga tries to support a lot of Linux distributions in order for you
to use Icinga where you want.

Check the matrix below about what distributions are supported with
which Icinga version.

If a concrete version number is mentioned, this means that the product won't be updated
to latest version on this platform. Consider updating your OS release.
